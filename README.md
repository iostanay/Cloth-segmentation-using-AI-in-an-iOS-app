# AI-Powered Cloth Segmentation for iOS ðŸŽ¨

## Overview
An innovative iOS application that leverages artificial intelligence to perform real-time cloth segmentation, allowing users to dynamically modify jacket colors using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space manipulation.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Cloth Segmentation**: Advanced AI model implementation for precise jacket detection
- **Dynamic Color Manipulation**: Interactive color adjustment using HSV color space
- **Seamless Integration**: Built natively for iOS using Swift and SwiftUI
- **Fashion-Forward Application**: Perfect for virtual try-on experiences and fashion applications

## Technical Implementation
The application combines computer vision techniques with deep learning to achieve accurate cloth segmentation. The color manipulation system utilizes HSV color space for more intuitive and precise color adjustments compared to traditional RGB values.

## Use Cases
- Virtual fitting rooms
- Fashion design applications
- E-commerce platforms
- Personal wardrobe management tools

## Coming Soon
Stay tuned for upcoming features and improvements! We're constantly working to enhance the user experience and expand the application's capabilities.
